# Astro

A little inertial space-flight simulator made using the Godot game engine.<br>

Controls: **WASD** for pitch/yaw. **QE** for roll. **Space** for thrust. **Click** to select an object as reference point.

This isn't a game yet, it's just a spaceship and an asteroid field to play around in. Emphasis was put in making the camera and controls feel smooth, and relatively intuitive. I say relatively - linear movement isn't damped which makes the ship a bit tricky to fly! Therein lies the fun, I'd like to make a racing game out of it sometime. There is no artificial speed limit (and currently no fuel limit!) so short of the physics engine eventually breaking, you can accelerate as far as you like. Angular movement _is_ damped, else it becomes truly untenable.

The controls and UI are based on Outer Wilds and Elite Dangerous. The space ship (capsule?) was made in Blender, the asteroids generated programmatically.
